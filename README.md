# Notification-Caller
DevHacks 2018 Security Challenge

Script that runs in the backgrounds. Waits for notifications from an email adress and pushes a phone call to a registered user (you have to specify the phone number). If that user doesn't respond, it will send an SMS to him.

I have blurred out the API keys and personal information, so you have to put in your own details to test it :>
